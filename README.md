# Algorithms-and-Structures
This file will be a collection of sample algorithms and data structures.

I tried to minimize the difficulty of implementing these algorithms and structures and I made them easier to be utilized for 
specific problem solving.

Hopefully this will be helpful to you! And if you have suggestions for changing and improving, feel free to do so.
